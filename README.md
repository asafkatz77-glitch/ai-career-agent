# ai-career-agent
An LLM-based conversational agent that represents my professional profile and answers questions about my experience, background, and career decisions.
The agent is powered by the OpenAI API and uses my LinkedIn profile (uploaded as PDF) and an additional structured text file as its knowledge base.
It is designed to simulate a professional conversation while maintaining factual accuracy based only on verified source documents.
